        <p>This 5-panel storyboard tells the story of 9-year old Kelvin and his 36-year old mother Alex. Kelvin is extremely interested in science and Alex wants to support Kelvin's interests.</p>
        <p>Alex brings Kelvin to the Art Ark, which she knows is a combination of color, nature, and science. At the Art Ark, Kelvin encounters the interactive color game, which prompts him to choose the right color of the leaves in the picture. Kelvin chooses the incorrect answer, and the game, rather than chiding him, explains to Kelvin why the leaves are actually green. In this way, Kelvin gains a deeper understanding of color and how it plays into his perception of his environment.</p>

        <p>The story follows the same path. Except there is a change in the game. It is still a single player game but it can be interactive and multi-player. Instead of a screen that gives you two options to choose from, the user is forced to see the screen with information on colors before moving back to the game.</p>
