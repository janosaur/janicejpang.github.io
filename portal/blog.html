        </div>
        <p>I actually read all 3 articles and was able to relate to each one on both a personal and professional level – especially on the topic of digital literacy. The article I related most to, however, was Haley Mlotek’s “<a href="http://www.torontostandard.com/industry/when-she-codes-the-revolutions-coming/" target="_blank" title="Go to article 'When She Codes, The Revolution's Coming'">When She Codes, The Revolution’s Coming</a>.”</p>
        <p>I found it interesting that many of the Ladies Learning Code (CCC) founders and instructors do not identify themselves nor the organization as feminist. Laura Plant reasoned, “[LLC] receives an enormous amount of support from men, and we wouldn’t be where we are today without it.” In her statement, Plant assumes that feminism, by definition, excludes men; thus, her organization does not wish to identify as feminist.</p>
        <p>This assumption is similar to the one adopted by Emma Watson in her HeForShe campaign speech before the United Nations. In her speech, Watson addresses gender inequality and extends an invitation to men to take action against it. Following her speech, social media (ie. Twitter) was mainly happy that someone with such a large platform took a stand against gender inequality. Some, however, were more critical, arguing that Watson suggested the reason men haven’t been involved in the fight for gender equality is simply that women haven’t invited them to, and that women have been unwelcoming towards men in this fight.</p>
        <p>Anyone with a basic knowledge of women’s suffrage, however, knows this is untrue. Addressing that gender inequalities exist largely because men benefit from it is wholly different from excluding men. From my understanding, feminism is all about inclusivity; feminism seeks to raise awareness of the current social structure that largely benefits men while oppressing women. Feminism promotes equitable opportunities between men and women.</p>
        <p>As I turned the page – since I printed out Mlotek’s article – I was pleased to find she noted “that the predominant reason for not identifying as a feminist is a fundamental misunderstanding of the word.”</p>
        <p>I also appreciated the connection that Mlotek made between misunderstandings between feminists and coders. As a designer, I believe it’s my role to lessen mitigate these kinds of misunderstandings; to – as Don Norman put it – “make things understandable”.</p>
