            <h1>Twitter Interface Analysis</h1>
            <p class="date">04.14.2015</p>
        </div>
       <p>Several times a day – especially and compulsively while I should be completing another project – I type “<em>twi</em>” into the address bar of my Chrome browser. Autofill completes the rest, directing me to twitter.com. When the page loads, I am presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7544281/7145169/03d09966-e29f-11e4-8d62-48d332f8f2d4.png" alt="Twitter web homepage"></p>
        

<p>For the purpose of this blog post, I will evaluate the desktop view of the Twitter feed according to the interaction design principles detailed in Bill DeRouchey’s presentation, “<a href=”http://www.melodiesinmarketing.com/2011/01/21/interaction-design-principles-bill-derouchey-experience-dialogue/” target=”_blank” title=”Link to Learning Interaction Design From Everyday Objects website”>Learning Interaction Design From Everyday Objects</a>”. More specifically, I will evaluate this design by its ability to provide the user priority, clarity, and purpose.
</p>

<p>At first glance, there does not appear to be a clear visual hierarchy between tweets – particularly between in font size, which I consider the greatest the foremost indicator of hierarchy. Upon closer inspection, however, it’s clear that Twitter’s interface has been carefully designed with a democratic spirit as its driver.</p>

<p>Unlike Facebook which employs algorithms to determine the News Feed content, the contents of Twitter’s feed is determined solely by time of posting, with the most recent tweets loaded at the top of the feed. Additionally, Twitter indicates when new tweets have been tweeted in the time that the user has been browsing their Twitter feed.</p>

<p><img src=”https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7544281/7146594/7206ffec-e2a9-11e4-9802-8f1957e13b3e.png” width="200" alt=”Facebook feed”>

</p>
<p>Twitter provides users a sense of personal agency in following other Twitter users. One’s Twitter feed is determined by other users one follows; thus, users have much more agency to determine what kind of content appears in their feed just by who they follow.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Within each tweet on Twitter’s feed, there <em>is</em> a clear sense of hierarchy. The avatar is a large visual indicator of who is tweeting. Directly to the right, the user’s display name is bolded and followed by the user’s handle, or username, and the time of the tweet in a lighter grey and smaller font size. This information reinforces who is tweeting and when they tweeted.</p>

<p>In the case of retweets, the avatar and tweet information are preceded by a “retweet” icon and a phrase stating, “[User’s display name] retweeted”. This informs users that the tweet they are seeing was retweeted by another user they follow.</p> 

<p><img src=”https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7544281/7146603/79e3f134-e2a9-11e4-9745-e14a9b0a0fd4.png” alt=”Screenshot of a retweet”>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, people retweet for one of two reasons: 1) They agree with or support the statement being tweeted, and want to share that statement with their followers; 2) They disagree with the statement tweeted, and want to ridicule or prove a point by sharing that statement with their followers. When a user retweets for reason #2, they will usually follow the retweet with a tweet like, “LRT (last retweet) [user’s thoughts on why that retweet was ridiculous]”. Additionally, many users include phrases like “LRT =/= endorsement” in their Twitter profiles to indicate that they tend to retweet not for reason #1, but #2. In this way, Twitter becomes a medium for users to quickly cite one and respond to one another.</p>

<p>Beyond the retweet and user information, the actual tweet content is displayed in normal font. The constrained width of the tweet box ensures that the text box maintains a reasonable length.</p>

<p>Below the tweet are several action icons; from left to right: reply, retweet, favorite, and more options. Hovering over these icons changes its color and prompts a speech bubble with the name of the action; this is an effective system of indicating actionable items.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>When the user hovers over a tweet in their feed, the background will turn a light grey to indicate that the tweet is clickable. Upon clicking the tweet, the tweet expands and separates itself from the rest of the feed. More detailed information and options – such as who has favorited or retweeted this tweet, and the exact time and date of the tweet – become available with this expansion.</p>

<p>From its democratic approach to content loading, to the textual hierarchy in individual tweets, to its intuitive icon system, Twitter has demonstrated a solid understanding and application of priority, clarity, and purpose in interaction design.</p>

            <h1>Response Paper</h1>
            <p class="date">04.07.2015</p>
        </div>
        <p>I actually read all 3 articles and was able to relate to each one on both a personal and professional level – especially on the topic of digital literacy. The article I related most to, however, was Haley Mlotek’s “<a href="http://www.torontostandard.com/industry/when-she-codes-the-revolutions-coming/" target="_blank" title="Go to article 'When She Codes, The Revolution's Coming'">When She Codes, The Revolution’s Coming</a>.”</p>
        <p>I found it interesting that many of the Ladies Learning Code (LLC) founders and instructors do not identify themselves nor the organization as feminist. Laura Plant reasoned, “[LLC] receives an enormous amount of support from men, and we wouldn’t be where we are today without it.” In her statement, Plant assumes that feminism, by definition, excludes men; thus, her organization does not wish to identify as feminist.</p>
        <p>This assumption is similar to the one adopted by Emma Watson in her HeForShe campaign speech before the United Nations. In her speech, Watson addresses gender inequality and extends an invitation to men to take action against it. Following her speech, social media (ie. Twitter) was mainly happy that someone with such a large platform took a stand against gender inequality. Some, however, were more critical, arguing that Watson suggested the reason men haven’t been involved in the fight for gender equality is simply that women haven’t invited them to, and that women have been unwelcoming towards men in this fight.</p>
        <p>Anyone with a basic knowledge of women’s suffrage, however, knows this is untrue. Addressing that gender inequalities exist largely because men benefit from it is wholly different from excluding men. From my understanding, feminism is all about inclusivity; it seeks to raise awareness of the current social structure that largely benefits men while oppressing women. Feminism promotes equitable opportunities between men and women.</p>
        <p>As I turned the page, I was pleased to find she noted “that the predominant reason for not identifying as a feminist is a fundamental misunderstanding of the word.” I appreciated the connection that Mlotek made between misunderstandings between feminists and coders. As a designer, I believe it’s my role to lessen mitigate these kinds of misunderstandings; to – as Don Norman put it – “make things understandable”.</p>
