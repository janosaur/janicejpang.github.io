      <h1>Sleep & Creativity</h1>
    
<div class="row">

     <p class="intro">
     In <a href="http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/110604.pdf">a study published in the journal <em>Sleep</em></a>, 
     researchers subjected a group of college students to thirty-six hours without sleep. 
     The researchers then presented the students a random image and asked them to respond with:<br>
<br>
     a) questions that struck them when they saw the image;<br> 
     b) possible causes of the event occurring in the image;<br>
     c) possible consequences of the event.<br><br>
What the researchers discovered, unsurprisingly, was that the test group subjected to sleeplessness performed 
significantly worse on the exercises compared to the control group which received an adequate amount of sleep. 
The test group students were unable to draw as many new connections, 
often repeating the same solutions and answers to new problems or situations which would otherwise require different approaches.
     <br><br>
</div>
    
    <div class="four columns">
    <p class="bullet">The purpose of the researchers' exercise was to test the students’ divergent thinking, 
or ability to produce unique ideas. Using Processing, 
I was able to visually communicate what I learned 
(both about the relationship between sleep & divergent thinking, and boolean expressions in Processing) 
into three iterations, explained in detail below.
    <br><br>The main takeaway: <br>Get a good night’s sleep, y'all.</p>

  <p class="weights">Iteration #1</p>

<div class="row">   
<div class="twelve columns">

<p class="intro"><br>In the first iteration, I wanted explore how the amount of sleep you get affects 
     your divergent thinking — your brain’s ability, or motivation, to create and develop connections.</p>

  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7544281/6317495/308f8cb2-ba0b-11e4-9ad3-ed52f76b6ea0.jpg">
   
  <p class="intro"> <br>
The light blue area of the circle represents the amount of sleep you get, with the different shades of blue representing the ratio of sleep each sleep cycle occupies.
</p>   
    
    <img class="u-max-full-width" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7544281/6317497/309b374c-ba0b-11e4-89a4-b0c19fe46dbe.jpg">
    
  <p class="intro">  <br>
From the circle bursts white lines of varying lengths, often accompanied by ellipses. The white lines represent the brain’s ability to think divergently. The larger the blue area, the further the lines reach; comparatively, the more sleep you get, the better your brain can develop and later utilize new connections.
</p>

<p class="intro"><br>
Additionally, as the background turns from blue to pink, the pink area of the circle disappears. This reflects how one can never truly regain lost sleep and how, throughout the day, one must operate only on the sleep they’ve received from the previous night.

    <p class="weights">Iteration #2</p>

<div class="row">   
<div class="twelve columns">

    <p class="intro"><br>In the second iteration, the bursting lines and ellipses create a map of the brain’s capability for divergent thinking. The more sleep one receives, represented by the light blue sectors, the better the brain is at developing new connections; alternatively, the further the lines can reach and the larger the ellipses can grow. And in the same way the right side of the brain best expresses creativity, the ellipses and lines tend to populate the right side of the screen.

 <p class="intro"><br>In the third and final iteration, I explored the effect of longterm sleep deprivation on creativity. Using the same mapping concept from my second iteration, I added the element of the turning ellipse. The ellipse turns counter-clockwise, collapsing the light blue segments till the ellipse turns dark blue, and eventually, static.

   <p class="intro"><br>As the light blue area dwindles to solid darkness, the bursting points become more and more confined. In the same way, the longer you go without sleep, the more limited your divergent thinking becomes.</p>
