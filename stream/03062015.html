   <h1>I've lost a lot of creativity in 2 years.</h1>

    <p class="intro">Looking at my blog posts from the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore year of college, I realize I haven't let myself experiment in that way in a long time. That summer, I took an art class at a local community college.
    For three hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I and 14 other students sat in a stuffy studio and <em>made things.</em>
    The assignments were a mix of intro art class repetitiveness ("Draw a ball from 15 different angles!") 
    and more abstract challenges like the paper cutout below. 
    </p>

     <p class="bullet"><em>An early assignment from my art class. Damn, look at that CRAFTSMANSHIP (I joke). <a href="http://todayjanicemade.tumblr.com/post/26816161749/construction-paper-cutouts-on-vellum-bristol-14">See more paper cutouts on my Tumblr</a>.</em></p>
    
    <p class="intro">Two years ago, I had sense of creative freedom I now feel I lack; 
    I attribute that freedom to <em>time</em>. I had time then – 
    time uninterrupted by obligations of classes, two jobs, etc. – to experiment; 
    to start something from scratch if I didn't like it; to <em>play</em>.
<br><br>  
    Perhaps I'm simply more efficient at making things I can be proud of than I was two years ago, and am thus required to do more to achieve that same feeling. Something about working in that stuffy studio, though, felt so much more rewarding.
    <br><br>
    As I wrote in my <a href="/stream/03032015">last blog post</a>, these past 6 months have been overwhelming for me. They've been rewarding, sure, but they've also left little time for personal growth or care.
    <br><br>
    This past Wednesday, over <em>ddukbokki</em> and hot tea, I told my parents my plans to take Spring Quarter off, or at least part-time.
    When they asked why, I explained how, since Fall Quarter, stress had been building, building, building.
   This was the first time I'd ever admitted to my parents any sentiment of <em>not being okay</em>.
    <br><br>
    Neither of them spoke for a few seconds – unusual during our meals – their brows slightly furrowed.
    <br><br>
    "Thank you for telling us," my dad said, emphasizing <em>you</em> and <em>us</em>. His brows softened.
    <br><br>
    I'm not sure what kind of reaction I was expecting from them, but my dad's words were relieving.
    I felt validated in my decision to let myself take a break –
    to focus on two or three things (instead of six or seven) and really dedicate myself to them.
    <br><br>

    <p class="intro">
    Next quarter, I'm looking forward to having more time. What I'll do with that time I'm still figuring out.
    I'm still battling with whether I feel like I'm giving in / up,
    but I'm taking fact that I feel emotionally lighter & mentally clearer as a good sign.

    If you've read this far, please take this song and it's lovely forest sounds as my thank you:</p>
