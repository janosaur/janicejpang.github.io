   <h1>I've lost a lot of creativity in 2 years.</h1>

    <p class="intro">Looking at my blog posts from the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore year of college, I realize I haven't let myself experiment in that way in a long time. That summer, I took an art class at a local community college.
    For three hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I and 14 other students sat in a stuffy studio and <em>made things.</em>
    The assignments were a mix of intro art class repetitiveness ("Draw a ball from 15 different angles!") 
    and more abstract challenges like the paper cutout below. 
    </p>

     <p class="bullet"><em>An early assignment from my art class. Damn, look at that CRAFTSMANSHIP (I joke). <a href="http://todayjanicemade.tumblr.com/post/26816161749/construction-paper-cutouts-on-vellum-bristol-14">See more paper cutouts on my Tumblr</a>.</em></p>
    
    <p class="intro">Two years ago, I had sense of creative freedom I now feel I lack; I attribute that freedom to <em>time</em>. I had time then – time uninterrupted by obligations of classes, two jobs, etc. – to experiment; to start something from scratch if I didn't like it; to <em>play</em>.
    <br><br>
    Perhaps I'm quicker at making things I can be proud of – or perhaps I really have lost that creative spark and am simply following UX/UI patterns –
    but something about working in that stuffy studio or in that stuffy room, and working to just try something new,
    felt so much more rewarding.
    <br><br>
    As I mentioned in my <a href="/stream/03032015">last blog post</a>, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed.
    <br><br>
    Last Wednesday, over <em>ddukbokki</em> and hot tea, I told my parents my plans to take Spring Quarter off, or at least part-time.
    When they asked why, I explained how, since Fall Quarter, stress had been building, building, building.
    I think it was the first time I'd ever admitted to my parents any feelings of stress or anxiety.
    <br><br>
    Neither of them spoke for a few seconds – unusual during our meals – looking at me.
    <br><br>
    "Thank you for telling us," my dad said.
    <br><br>
    
    I'm not sure what kind of reaction I was expecting from them, but my dad's words were relieving.
    I felt validated in my decision to let myself take a break next quarter – to let myself focus on two or three things (instead of six or seven) and really dedicate myself to them.
    <br><br>

    <p class="intro">
    Next quarter, I'm looking forward to having a lot more time. I'm still battling with whether I feel like I'm giving in or giving up,
    but I'm taking fact that I feel a huge weight lifted off me as a good sign.
