    <h1>There are 168 hours in one week.</h1>

    <p class="intro">Last week, I spent 21 of them sleeping – an average of 3 hours per night. I have this horrible habit of believing that I can accomplish 28 hours worth of tasks in 24 because my lifestyle the past 6 months has proved to me I can. So long as I inhale caffeine, forgo sleep, and indefinitely postpone my friend’s invitations to hang out – I can.

    <p class="intro"><br>
   LitMix is a new side project which pairs two of my deepest interests: literature & music. 
   I had the idea while reading Nathanel Rich's dystopian novel, 
   <a href="http://lit-mix.tumblr.com/post/112402938586/mitchell-zukor-mathematician-and-protagonist-of" target="_blank"><em>Odds Against Tomorrow</em></a>. 
   Protagonist Mitchell Zukor's incessant and infectious fear of the future read eerily like Win Butler's warbles in Arcade Fire's "Modern Man".
   <br><Br>
   As the story progressed, I drew more connections between Mitchell's bleak outlook 
   and the music I was listening to at the time (perhaps this reveals more about my taste in music than anything).
  <br><br>
  I decided, then, to more deliberately draw these connections in the form of mixes.
  Like the <a href="http://pangcake.land/forest/album">mixes</a> I create for friends and family, 
  I curated a list of songs with specific characters and overarching themes in mind.
  <br><br>
  While I found the book itself underwhelming – the initially charistmatic characters fall flat in the end – 
  I found the exercise of pairing passages with melodies extremely rewarding!   <br><br>
 The most challenging aspect of curating this mix was pairing songs not only with the contents of the book, 
 but with the rest of the mix as well.  
 To ease transitions, I relied heavily on songs with minor chord progressions; 
 thankfully is a common characteristic in songs with a "run-away-from-your-feelings" subject matter.
<br><br>
  For the next volume of LitMix, 
  it would be an interesting challenge to create a mix for a nonfiction book. 
  I am – slowly but steadily – reading Daniel Kahneman's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow" target="_blank">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>. Until next time!

    “The way other people fantasize about surprise inheritances, firts-glance love, and endless white empyreal pastures, Mitchell dreamed of an erupting supervolcano that would bury North America under a foot of hot ash.”

    “So I wait in line, I'm a modern man /<br>
And the people behind me, they can't understand /<br>
Makes me feel like /<br>
Something don't feel right."<br>
