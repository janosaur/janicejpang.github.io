    <h1>There are 168 hours in one week.</h1>

    <p class="intro">Last week, I spent 21 of them sleeping – an average of 3 hours per night. I have this horrible habit of believing that I can accomplish 28 hours worth of tasks in 24 because my lifestyle the past 6 months has proved to me I can. So long as I inhale caffeine, forgo sleep, and indefinitely postpone my friend’s invitations to hang out – I can.
</p>

    <div class="row">  
    <div class="eight columns">
 <p class="intro">In the past 6 months, since Senior year kicked off in October, I’ve pushed myself professionally and personally harder than I ever have – and it’s paid off. My professors, peers, and friends have acknowledged that the work I’ve been doing has had positive effects on the communities I care about. To be more specific, every week for the past 6 months – outside of the 60 hours spent completing projects for and attending class – I have dedicated:
 </p></div>
 <div class="four columns"><p class="bullet">
• 12 hours working with and leading an amazing graphic design team;<br><br>
• 15 hours preparing, facilitating, and improving the graphic design club;<br><br>
• 10 hours preparing course material to teach a design seminar this spring;<br><br>
• 3 hours freelancing for non-profits;<br><br>
• 4 hours volunteering with the homeless shelter.<br><br>
</p>
</div></div>

  <div class="row">  
    <div class="eight columns">
 <p class="intro">Every week for the past 6 months, however, has also included:</p>
 </div>
 <div class="four columns"><p class="bullet">
• 4 hours seeing a chiropractor, who ascribed my <a href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/temporomandibular-disorders-tmd">TMJ</a> to poor posture and unconscious teeth grinding – due largely to, <em>surprise</em>, stress;
<br><br>• -60 hours <a href="/forest/sleep">sleeping</a>.<br><br>
</p>
</div></div>


 <div class="row">  
    <div class="eight columns">
 <p class="intro">As well as these incalculable side effects:</p>
 </div>
 <div class="four columns"><p class="bullet">
• An extreme loss of appetite and consideration for things that are not: 1) Quick; 2) Convenient; 3) Reheatable;<br><br>
• An increased dependence on dry shampoo, as the amount of time available for personal hygiene has plummeted;<br><br>
• A decreased immune system, likely linked to the above two and the fact that I live with 9 people;<br><br>
• An apathy towards people who are not in my immediate social circle.</p>
</div></div>


<div class="row">  
    <div class="twelve columns">
    
 <p class="intro">As I type this post, the heavy hands of my anxiety lay on my shoulders. They refuse to let me forget the ever-growing list of things I need to finish (designs I need to update, people I need to email, a syllabus I need to revise) by 7am tomorrow – at which time I’ll hop in a bus, a shuttle, another shuttle, and a car to reach my chiropractor by 10:30. </p>

 <p class="intro">For me, quantification of my reality is becoming increasingly important because my goals tend to lie in the abstract. There is a difference between doing good, meaningful work, and doing work for the sake of being able to say you're doing it. <em>Go above and beyond with this project,</em> I say. But what does that entail? How long will that take, and do I have the time and mental resources to do it well?</p>

 <p class="intro">I’m becoming better at saying No, and learning when it needs to be said. When taking on another project, class, or opportunity will cause the quality of what I’m already doing to suffer, it’s time to flex my rejection muscles. What also helps is this question my faculty mentor left me with when I disclosed my ambitious goals for my design seminar:<br><br></p>

<center><h2>“Is this sustainable?”</h2></center>

 <p class="intro"><br>Being honest with myself, my habits these past 6 months were not, at all; it’s time I acknowledge that and start working towards habits that are.<br></p>
