        <p>3rd-grader Mara first tested our game. We had some technical difficulties with our full game not appearing in the viewscreen. Thus Maura spent some time figuring out where the cup feature was in our game. Once she found where to drop the fruit, the game was very easy for her. She managed to play through the game five or six times. She found the only challenging part was realizing you could re-use the same fruit. Maura suggested that there should be an indication of whether you’ve picked the right fruit or not.</p>

<p>4th-grader Saunder also tested our game. Like Mara, Saunder also demonstrated confusion when prompted to drag more than 1 blue fruit; he tried to drag purple fruits instead because “purple is closest to blue.” Realizing that purple fruits did not decrease the count, he then tried – and succeeded – to drag the 1 blue fruit into the cup. To remedy this confusion, Saunder suggested adding “a sign that says you can use more than 1 of each fruit.”</p>

<p>To make the game more challenging, he recommended adding a timer to the gameplay page. This, he argued, would force the player to quickly recognize the color and the similarly-colored fruits. Saunder also suggested that, after pressing the “Blend!” button, there should be a transition animation “that blends all the colors” – this would make the outcome, the resulting smoothie – more rewarding! Finally, he suggested adding sound effects throughout the game to “catch people’s attention.”</p>
