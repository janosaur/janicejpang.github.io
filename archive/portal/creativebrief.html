        <p><strong>project summary</strong></p>
        <p>The Crocker is seeking color-related projects to include in their mobile Art Ark exhibition; more specifically, the Crocker would like projects that explore color through the lens of art, nature, and science. Projects chosen for inclusion have the possibility of traveling with the Art Ark for 3 years, with opportunities for iteration and improvement.</p>
<p>Our proposed project is, at its core, a color-matching game. The users will first be presented with a short video of a leaf; as the seasons change, so does the color of the leaf – from green to red to brown. The users will then be prompted to group an assortment of leaves by color and by season. Because there will be many leaves to be sorted, there is an opportunity to multiple children to participate in this game.</p>
<p>With our game, our goal is to expand children’s color recognition and seasonal association.</p>
 <p class="linebreak"></p>  
       <p><strong>audience profile</strong></p>
        <p>The audience are the visitors of the Art Ark; more specifically, elementary school children between the ages of 6 and 12. The Art Ark can hold up to 30 children at a time.</p>
<p>Because this is a traveling exhibition, the children who visit the Art Ark will have varying levels of exposure to and experience with screen-based technologies. The visitors will also have varying levels of reading familiarity.
</p>
<p>To accommodate the variety of users, the game will guide the user with both simple, text-based instructions and audio recordings. The user will be prompted to interact with the screen by tapping and dragging motions; a hand-icon on the screen will exemplify how the user should interact with the screen as instructions are prompted.</p>
 <p class="linebreak"></p>  
 <p><strong>perception / positioning</strong></p>
        <p>We will be creating an interactive screen-based game. The user will have to drag their finger across the screen to move leaves around.</p>
        <p>Limitations include the child’s interest in the game and the amount of time available for the child to play the game. The children will have between 2-10 minutes to dedicate to a single station in the Art Ark. Moving forward, we will have to be strategic about the amount of time we are asking the child to dedicate to this game.
</p>
<p class="linebreak"></p> 
 <p><strong>look & feel</strong></p>
        <p>Our project will rely heavily on the user’s perception of color and ability to match colors they perceive as being the same.</p>
        <p>The color palette will depend heavily on the color of the leaves. We plan to illustrate the leaves in a flat-design style, which will allow for clear color choices. Otherwise, the only other color besides that of the leaves will be the black background.</p>
        <p>The type will be in white text against the black background. Because we will only use text to imply instructions, our typography will only include one san-serif font in one font size; pur goal is to maintain consistency.

 <p><strong>targeted message</strong></p>
        <p>Things in nature can change colors over time.</p>
