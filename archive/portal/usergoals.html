        <h1>User Goals</h1>
            <p class="date">05.21.2015</p>
        
        <p>What is your vision of what your team will make?</p>
        <p>We are creating, at the core, a color-matching game. More specifically: an 8-bit one.</p>
        <p>On the landing screen, the title of the game "Groovy Smoothies" will appear. A "Let's Blend!" button will pulse, indicating to the user to click the button.</p>
        <p>On the second screen, the main screen (a scene of a smoothie blender surrounded by fruits) with a greyed out overlay will provide the user a quick tutorial via tool tips.</p>
        <p>The first tool tip will indicate the instructions. The second tool tip, the fruits that the user can drag to the cup. The third, the counter indicating how many fruits (out of 5 fruits) have been successfully dragged into the cup. And lastly, the "Blend!" button, which the user can press once the 5 fruits have been successfully added into the cup.</p>
        <p>The third screen will be the actual game play. The user will read the instructions (ex. "Drag three red ingredients into the cup!"), then drag the correspondingly-colored number of fruits of that color into the cup. If the user chooses an incorrectly colored fruit, a modal will appear informing them so. If they choose the right fruit,  a color block appears in the cup, the counter increases by one! Once the user has successfully filled the cup with 5 fruits, the "Blend!" button will activate.</p> 
        <p>The fourth screen will be a loading animation of the blender blending all the fruits into a smoothie.</p>
        <p>The final screen will state, "Congratulations!" and present the final smoothie, colored as a combination of all the fruit colors. The user will be prompted to "Blend Again!" to start the game over.</p>
 <p class="linebreak"></p>  
       <p><strong>What are your primary objectives?</strong></p>
        <p>The primary objective of Groovy Smoothies is to reinforce color-name recognition and association with yummy yummy food!  The user should be able to recognize colors  and associate them by name.</p>
 <p class="linebreak"></p>  
 <p><strong>How will you communicate your objectives to your audience?</strong></p>
        <p>We will communicate our objectives through a web-based game application. We will utilize text, image, and animation to effectively communicate our objectives. </p>
<p class="linebreak"></p> 
 <p><strong>What information and functions do your users need? And in what form do they need it?</strong></p>
        <p>The user needs to know what to do with their hands. The user should be able to recognize the color indicated in the instructions and match that to the colors of the fruit available to drag-and-drop into the cup; the user will then need to drag and drop correspondingly-colored fruit and vegetables into a cup. 
</p>
<p class="linebreak"></p>  
 <p><strong>How do users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media your team is creating?</strong></p>
        <p>Our users are elementary school children; their experience levels with touchscreen technology will vary, as will their experience levels with reading. To accommodate for all children, we will include both visual & auditory instructions and cues.</p>
